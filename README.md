# YARA
Qubit Security YARA Project

My job as an Intern at Qubit Security was to investigate the use of a pattern-matching tool called YARA to detect SQL Injection and Ransomware activities. 
Ultimately, I was responsible for the company's first steps with YARA, and for deciding whether or not YARA should be incorporated within Plura.io, Qubit's cloud service application that detects malware in real-time.
