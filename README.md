# YARA
Qubit Security YARA Project

My job as an Intern at Qubit Security was to investigate the use of a pattern-matching tool called <a href="http://virustotal.github.io/yara/">YARA</a> to detect SQL Injection and Ransomware activities. YARA finds suspicious strings within log files and reports it to the user for analysis. 
Ultimately, I was responsible for the company's first steps with YARA, and for deciding whether or not YARA should be incorporated within Plura.io, Qubit's cloud service application that detects malware in real-time.

This project was developed at <a href="http://en.qubitsec.com/"> Qubit Security</a>.
